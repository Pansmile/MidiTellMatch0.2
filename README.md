# MidiTellMatch0.2
First version of java-based MIDI-message translator with included MIDI-monitor.
The app allows you to create MIDI Tell-Matches wich are the MIDI-message translator. Every Tell-Match listens to a selected source
in your MIDI environment and looking for specific message, wich triggers another message to be sent to selected destinations in your MIDI environment.

To use this App, just download MidiTellMatch0.2.jar.
If you are a mac user, i'll recomend to use DereK Cook's CoreMidi4J library in order to provide support of SysEx messages.
Using this library will also allow you to update app's MIDI environment durring runtime.
You can find CoreMidi4J on GitHub: 
https://github.com/DerekCook/CoreMidi4J.

I'll add the detailed manual later.
